Library Systems are the means and methods of organizing a library otherwise 
it is just a random collection of stuff. Along with most professions, 
librarians increasingly depend on their technology to manage and organize 
their collections for the benefit of their users. These collections are more 
diverse and require increasingly sophisticated systems.

It was in the late 1970s and early 1980s that electronic catalog started to be 
developed and offered by larger institutions. These first generation catalogs 
usually tried to mimic the card catalog already understood by library patrons 
and were primarily text-based and accessed through dump terminals connected 
to a central mainframe computer. The bibliographic format behind theses early 
catalogs is still the dominate bibliographic format and is called 
Machine-Readable Cataloging or [MARC][MRC]. 
[MARC][MRC] was the result of the efforts by [Henriette Avram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Avram) 
of the Library of Congress, 
among others, to create an electronic cataloging format for record interchange. 

Here is David Foster Wallace's [Infinite Jest](http://encore.coalliance.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb28049868__S0316920045__Orightresult__X3?lang=eng&suite=def&marcData=Y) 
in MARC21 format.

The start of the 1990s was a move away from the main-frame to a client-server
model for library systems, including the arrival of "Online Public Access Catalog" 
or (OPAC). Almost immediately, these often primitive OPACS were much more 
popular among library users than the physical card catalog or first-generation
"text-based" catalogs of the 1970s and 1980s. The designs of these early OPACs
reflected two different access models, one deeply ground in assumptions and
behavior of using the physical card catalog with author, title, and subject
access points and the other was in the commercial data services of the time, like
[DIALOG][DIALOG]. [DIALOG][DIALOG] was an early online information services that included
access to a number of full-text journal databases, the service still exists as
a product from ProQuest.

The market for library automation platforms is dominated by a few large
private corporations, often with multiple product lines that blur the
largely marketing categories of library systems, including commercial
integrated library systems (ILS), discovery services, and the latest 
term, library services platforms. The main differences between an ILS
and library services platforms have to do more with infrastructure and 
implementation than necessarily new end-user functionality although most
focus on a single-search interface to increasingly larger databases of
both local and remote resources owned by the library.

Every year, Marshall Breeding releases a report on the state of library
systems and technology with the [2017 report](https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2017/05/01/library-systems-report-2017/)
