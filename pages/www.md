While the term "World Wide Web" seems somewhat archaic in the 
worlds of the monstrous corporate technologies giants as 
Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, all grew at their tremendous
pace very much enabled by the Internet and the growth of websites
and web technology. 

## Google and Amazon
More than any other company, [Google's](https://www.google.com/) search service looms over the
design and expectations users have for their library systems, including
catalogs and scholarly databases. At first, the reactions of librarians and technology 
vendors was to dismiss Google while using Google themselves for their own research. 

As users become accustomed to the quirks and results of Google's user interface, some publishers
of electronic resources are modifying their own search interfaces to mimic Google. Other
publishers and library system vendors are taking other approaches by trying to differentiate 
their own user interfaces and algorithms which provides other challenges, especially those
librarians and teachers instructing students on information literacy for high school and
undergraduate education.

While [Amazon's](https://www.amazon.com/) main site is not known of it's search, Amazon's product display, in particular
for printed and ebooks, has been an important source of inspiration and duplication by most 
library "discovery" products. Amazon popularized the prominent display of the Book Cover along
with filters (or facets) for narrowing search results.  

## Facebook and Twitter Social Networks
While the impacts on library systems by most-popular social networking websites 
like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/) 
have not had the impact as Google or Amazon, their have been some attempts to adding
"sharing" capabilities to various library ILS, Discovery Layers, and electronic 
article databases.
