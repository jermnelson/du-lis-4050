Institutional or Digital Repositories and Open-source and Commercial Discover Layers 
are recent additions to the library systems that started in early-to-mid 2000s.

## Institutional Repositories
Institutional Digital Repositories are a class of software for preserving and 
accessing digital content. To properly store digital objects requires that 
the digital repository meet two 
challenges; first, is the physical preservation of the digital object on either a
hard-drive (even if that hard-drive is abstracted in a virtual server) or other
magnetic or optical medium like digital tape or CD-ROM. The second challenge is
making sure that the data is accessibility through software means. Often digital
objects become unusable because of a combination of the two; i.e. the digital object
can only be accessed through an obsolete software program and is located on old media
like a floppy disk.


## Discovery Layers
Discovery systems, both open-source ([Blacklight][BL], [VuFind][VF]) or commercial 
products like Innovative Interfaces' [Encore](https://www.iii.com/products/sierra-ils/encore-discovery/),
Ex Libris [Summon](http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/Summon_Web-Scale_Discovery), OCLC's 
[WorldCat Local](), and [Ebsco's Discovery Service](https://www.ebscohost.com/discovery). 
All of these systems attempt to replicate a "Google" like search with puesdo-boolean searches on
indexes that include the library's catalog, digital repositories, and purchased and opens-access
article index and full-text databases.
