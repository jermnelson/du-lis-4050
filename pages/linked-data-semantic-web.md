Libraries and cultural heritage organizations are shifting from [MARC21][MRC] 
and XML metadata standards to Linked-Data vocabularies. Library Linked Data 
is an international effort to bring machine-readable data to the web. Based 
on RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs, Library Linked Data is made 
up a series of statements, called triples, that take the form of 
**subject - predicate - object**.
